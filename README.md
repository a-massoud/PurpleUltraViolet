## Hi, I'm @PurpleUltraViolet

- I'm interested in programming, math, and linguistics.
- I'm a high school student in Arizona, so I'm not too knowledgeable, but I'm always open to learning more.
- I'm always open to ideas.

#### My areas of “expertise”

I say “expertise” because I don't exactly have *expertise* being a teenager.

Programming languages I prefer using:
- C++
- Pure C
- Python
- Java
- Rust

#### My areas of interest

- Math
- Linguistics (I know, it's an odd one, but it's absolutely fascinating to me)
- Technology
- Computer Science

#### My hobbies

I love playing video games, watching shows, reading, and a lot of other standard hobbies.
I never claimed to be original.
